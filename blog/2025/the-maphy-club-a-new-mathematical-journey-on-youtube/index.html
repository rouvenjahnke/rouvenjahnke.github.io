MaPhy-Club represents our commitment to sharing original research and insights in mathematics and physics with a focus on formal reasoning and mathematical clarity.</p> <h3>Our First Video: A New Series Representation for π</h3> <p>Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwUNSINtpmk" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">inaugural video explores</a> an elegant and intriguing series representation for π that might not be familiar to many mathematicians. The expression claims that:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/874/1*afYI_kn9RE4XEqdnnveSPA.png"><figcaption>$$\pi = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n2^{n+1}((n-1)!)²}{(2n)!}$$</figcaption></figure> <p>This fascinating formula connects π to an infinite series involving factorials and powers of 2. In our video, we walk through a complete proof of this representation, starting from a general infinite series for the arcsine function and culminating in this elegant expression.</p> <p>The proof involves several transformations, including a clever substitution of 1/√2 into the arcsine series, which leads to an expression for π/4 that can be manipulated into our final form.</p> <p>Rather than revealing all the mathematical details here, I encourage you to watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwUNSINtpmk" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">full video</a> to appreciate the elegance of the proof and the mathematical insights it provides.</p> <h3>Obsidian: My Mathematical Companion</h3> <p>As I delve deeper into mathematical research for our YouTube channel, <a href="https://obsidian.md/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> has become an invaluable tool for my workflow. Here’s how I use it:</p> <p>Obsidian’s support for LaTeX makes it perfect for writing and storing mathematical equations. I can easily document formulas like our π representation:</p> <pre>$$\pi = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n2^{n+1}((n-1)!)^2}{(2n)!}$$</pre> <p>The bidirectional linking in Obsidian allows me to connect related mathematical concepts. When exploring series representations, I can link to notes on convergence properties, specific constants, or historical discoveries about π.</p> <p>Using Obsidian’s graph view, I can visualize how different mathematical concepts interconnect, revealing patterns and relationships that might not be immediately obvious in linear notes.</p> <p>I track the development of proofs through multiple iterations, keeping a record of false starts and breakthroughs alike. This has been particularly valuable as we developed the proof shown in our first video.</p> <p><em>But looking forward for a deeper article about my Obsidian worklflow in mathematics at unviersity.</em></p> <h3>Also Looking Forward: MaPhy-Club’s Mission</h3> <p>MaPhy-Club is dedicated to presenting original work in mathematics and physics. Our content is designed for advanced students, early-stage researchers, and anyone interested in the foundations and frontiers of exact science.</p> <p>As described in our channel’s mission statement:</p> <blockquote><em>“MaPhy-Club is a research-focused YouTube channel dedicated to presenting original work in mathematics and physics. Our aim is to contribute to the scientific discourse by offering well-structured, conceptually rigorous content that reflects ongoing investigations and independent theoretical developments.”</em></blockquote> <p>In future videos, we’ll be exploring more original insights in both mathematics and physics, always with a commitment to rigor and clarity. Topics on our radar include advanced calculus concepts, theoretical physics applications, and more explorations of fundamental constants like our first video’s examination of π.</p> <h3>Join Our Journey</h3> <p>I invite you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MaPhy-Club" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">subscribe to MaPhy-Club</a> and join us on this mathematical and physical exploration. Whether you’re a student, researcher, or simply curious about the beautiful world of exact sciences, our channel aims to provide content that challenges and inspires.</p> <p>And if you’re interested in how tools like Obsidian can enhance your own mathematical documentation and research, I’d be happy to share more specifics about my setup and workflow in future articles.</p> <p>Mathematics is a journey best taken together — I hope you’ll join us on ours.</p> <p><em>Rouven Jahnke is a mathematics enthusiast and co-creator of the MaPhy-Club YouTube channel. He uses Obsidian for documenting mathematical research and developing educational content.</em></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=bd258bd41e02" width="1" height="1" alt="">&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;<a href="https://medium.com/pure-mathematics/the-maphy-club-a-new-mathematical-journey-on-youtube-bd258bd41e02" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The MaPhy-Club: A New Mathematical Journey on YouTube</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pure-mathematics" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pure Mathematics</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</p> </body></html>
